# win-virtual-desktop-shortcuts
AutoHotkey script which allows you to directly switch between any Virtual desktops with a single shortcut instead of only being able to go to the adjacent ones.

You might need to adjust the timings for you if it doesn't work straight out of the box with your PC, e.g. increase Sleep timers, specifically for Win-Tab, but maybe also for Enter and Right. You can also change the keys of the shortcuts by changing the way SwitchDesktop in lines 4-13 is called. I tried to keep them as low as possible for my use case.
